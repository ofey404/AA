User Portrait
=============

## No. 0 user: myself

I'm a part-time writer, a DM in NGABBS TRPG forum.

I hope I could focus more on my content, plot line, rather than
handcrafting BBS code like `[dice]d100[/dice]` every time.

Besides, as my characters grow, I need a better way to manage them.
Better than use excel and plain text files.

I wish those problems could be solved:

- Automate dice code generation
  - Or a builtin dice tool.
  - Totally based on data and configuration file. The software itself
    should be a pure executor.

- An unified character setting management. All in one.
  - Ability Score
  - Equipment
  - Biography
  - Timeline
  - Relationship
  - Material management - charactor image and other.


## Hobbist on web-based TRPG

It should have a GUI, if I want to publish my work to other hobbists.

The availbility also matters. The most obvious way is to publish it
on Steam.

It should support code generation other than NGABBS Code, in the
architecture level.

- Both ways of random generation
  - Text Input: Parse external dice from Forum.
  - Builtin dice.
